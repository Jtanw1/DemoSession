YOUR NEXT PAYMENT IS DUE SOON

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear <%user.firstname%>

We're just dropping you a line to remind you that your next minimum 
payment of £<%user.customattribute.cstm_curr_1%> is due by <%user.customattribute.cstm_char_1%>. It's a good idea to make the 
payment as soon as you can. That way you won't miss the due date by 
mistake and end up being charged a late fee.

Remember, if you're able to pay more than the £<%user.customattribute.cstm_curr_1%> minimum, then you can 
reduce the interest you pay and clear your balance quicker. Around 7 out of 10 
customers are doing exactly that.

Once you've made this payment you can make sure your future payments 
are made on time automatically by setting up a Direct Debit.
